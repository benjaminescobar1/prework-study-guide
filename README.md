# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through Prework. It contains HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation for this was to gain knowledge about coding. I built this project because to educate myself on coding and webpage development. I also built this project as a study guide to refer to in the future. The problem this solves is creating the foundation, style, and operation of a webpage. I learned many things throughout this project but the most important is to not overlook item lines and pay attention to detail for order of operation of coding.
